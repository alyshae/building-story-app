# What’s that building?

## What is this project?
A one stop shop for all things building. See building facts, post your own stories and pictures.

## Why buildings?
At “What’s that building?” We have a love for building architecture, design and stories. We spend restless nights thinking, “Why did they build this?” “Who’s been through these hallways?” “Why is it shaped the way it shaped?”

So why not create a place to share all things building related.  

### What can I find in this repo?
This repository is for the organization and governance of the “What’s that building?” project as a whole. For code, see (https://github.com/drstrangele/building-story-app).
